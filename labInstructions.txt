Lab Assignment Requirements
==============================

Retrieve object data with a mouse click and populate the page with that data; push the lab branch to your repo and merge it.

1. Create a repo on Github for this project (a NEW ONE) - call it A3_Lab1. Initialize it with a Readme.

2. Using the Github GUI, create a new branch; edit the Readme (add some information about the project); merge the branch to master

3. Copy the repo link using the Clone This Repo button

4. Use the Terminal navigate to the Documents folder and clone the repo (refer to the guide if youâ€™re not sure how to do this)

5. Create a new working branch (dev.yourinitials.lab)

6. Unpack the lab files from FOL into the lab folder (unzip, copy and paste the contents - NOT the whole folder)

7. In the carData.js file, create the appropriate properties in each of the car objects (model, price, description) using the supplied car_data.txt text file

8. Write the JS variables / event handling / functions to retrieve the data and populate the elements on the index.html page.

9. When you click on a car thumb, the OTHER ones should fade out so that only the active one is full opacity (there's a CSS class near the bottom of the overrides.css file to use)

10. Add, commit and push your changes back to the GitHub repo

11. Merge your branch to Master; leave your working branch

12. Give yourselves a pat on the back - you did it!

13. REMOVE YOUR WORKING FILES FROM YOUR LAB COMPUTER (IF USING)

And submit the link to your repo to the lab dropbox on FOL
