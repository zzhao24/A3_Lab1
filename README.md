# A3_Lab1
This is the week7 project


## Retrieve object data with a mouse click and populate the page with that data; push the lab branch to your repo and merge it.

> Create a repo on Github for this project (a NEW ONE) - call it A3_Lab1. Initialize it with a Readme.

> Using the Github GUI, create a new branch; edit the Readme (add some information about the project); merge the branch to master

> Copy the repo link using the Clone This Repo button

> Use the Terminal navigate to the Documents folder and clone the repo (refer to the guide if youâ€™re not sure how to do this)

> Create a new working branch (dev.yourinitials.lab)

> Unpack the lab files from FOL into the lab folder (unzip, copy and paste the contents - NOT the whole folder)

> In the carData.js file, create the appropriate properties in each of the car objects (model, price, description) using the supplied car_data.txt text file

> Write the JS variables / event handling / functions to retrieve the data and populate the elements on the index.html page.

> When you click on a car thumb, the OTHER ones should fade out so that only the active one is full opacity (there's a CSS class near the bottom of the overrides.css file to use)

> Add, commit and push your changes back to the GitHub repo

> Merge your branch to Master; leave your working branch

> Give yourselves a pat on the back - you did it!

> REMOVE YOUR WORKING FILES FROM YOUR LAB COMPUTER (IF USING)

> And submit the link to your repo to the lab dropbox on FOL
